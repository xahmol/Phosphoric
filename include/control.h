/**
 * @file control.h
 * @brief IPC control mode for OricForge IDE integration (sprint 35a)
 *
 * Line-based protocol on stdin/stdout. Three message kinds :
 *   CMD  (client → emu)   ex: "step", "read $BB80 16"
 *   REP  (emu → client)   ex: "OK pc=0502 cycles=1234"
 *   EVT  (emu → client)   ex: "EVT stopped pc=0510 reason=break id=2"
 *
 * Activated via the --control CLI flag. Logs are routed to stderr by
 * the entry hook so stdout stays clean for protocol traffic.
